!!! note "Why?"

    Python is a great language for scientific computing, but it can be difficult
    to know where to start when it comes to tooling.

**The goal is to provide:**

- [x] brief, easily digestible overviews of the most important tools
- [x] fully documented templates for common tasks
- [x] detailed, in-depth guides for those looking to go deeper
- [x] links to official documentation for further reading
