# Python Tooling for Scientists

### ðŸš§ Coming Soon! ðŸš§

This site will provide an opinionated guide to Python tooling for scientists.

!!! note "Why?"

    Python is a great language for scientific computing, but it can be difficult
    to know where to start when it comes to tooling.

**The goal is to provide:**

- âœ… brief, easily digestible overviews of the most important tools
- âœ… fully documented templates for common tasks
- âœ… detailed, in-depth guides for those looking to go deeper
- âœ… links to official documentation for further reading

*Feel free to look around, but please be aware that this site is still under
development.  This message will be removed when the site is "ready" for public
consumption.*
